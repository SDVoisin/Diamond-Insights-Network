            <h1>Travis Bazzana</h1> 
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ng0I2LecQiU?si=tcyTTBRi1Hp_pIjS&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            Among the top prospects in the tournament was Australian superstar Travis Bazzana, former PAC-12 player of the year in 2024, Golden Spikes finalist, 2024 No.1 Pick overall by the Cleveland Guardians and their #1 Prospect. A well rounded player with no discernable weaknesses at the plate has been a joy to watch blossom as a prospect. Travis Bazzana’s 2024 performance with Team Australia showcased his consistency as a starter and his ability to contribute modestly at the plate. He hit .263 and reached base at a .333 clip, demonstrating a patient approach, though his power production was absent with a .263 slugging percentage. Despite some struggles with strikeouts (31.6% K Rate), Bazzana’s two stolen bases hint at his speed and potential as a dynamic baserunner. While his overall OPS of .596 points to limited offensive impact, his tools suggest he could grow into a more prominent contributor in the right circumstances. Although this all part of a small sample size, these stats reflect a player still adjusting and finding his rhythm at a competitive level, his performance and confidence on the international stage will come with maturity and repetitions in this tournament there was still a lot to dream on for the young aussie and did not disappoint scouts with his raw skill. 

           <h1> Chandler Simpson </h1>

          The 5-11 170 lb SS out of Georgia Tech University selected in the 2nd Round of the 2022 Amateur Draft by the Tampa Bay Rays and one of the fastest players in the minor leagues had arguably the top batting performance in the tournament this year. After a standout year his season split between A+ and AA where he hit .355 average and 104 stolen bases made him a true game changer between the lines where he was consistently looking for opportunities to contribute combining elite contact skills with game-changing speed. While his power remains limited, Simpson’s ability to get on base, disrupt defenses, and score runs makes him an invaluable asset. He continued this game changing performance in Coloso del Pacifico in Mexico, where he was a dominant force for Team USA. slashing an elite .459/.500/.514 across nine games. His contact ability was extraordinary, with just one strikeout in 37 at-bats, and his on-base skills made him a constant threat. While not a power hitter, Simpson’s speed and baserunning prowess continued to be game-changing, as evidenced by his 9 stolen bases without being caught all tournament.Additionally his 1.014 OPS reflects a well-rounded offensive bat, making him a key player in setting the tone for Team USA’s success. Simpson's blend of high average, on-base skills, and speed cements him as one of the tournament’s standout performers.

        <h1> Ryan Ward </h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tNqJ3-frUw?si=wB2t6ApfDKI-ZlR_&amp;controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            Another prospect from a stocked young USA team, 26 year old LH Infielder/Outfielder from Warchester, Massachusetts who attended Bryant University from 2016-2019 where he was then drafted in the 8th round by the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2019. He has made quick work of the minor league system, making it to a new level each year since entering Rookie ball. Ryan Ward has carved out a role as a reliable power hitter during his five seasons in the minor leagues. With a .258/.331/.488 slash line and 114 home runs, his offensive game is centered around his ability to drive in runs and provide extra-base power. While his strikeouts and batting average suggest room for improvement in contact and consistency, Ward’s .819 OPS and strong slugging percentage solidify him as a valuable middle-of-the-order bat. At the tournament this year he continued to show his reliability at the plate and in the field. Ryan Ward proved to be an offensive powerhouse during the 2024 tournament. His combination of power (.885 SLG, five home runs) and clutch performance (11 RBIs) made him one of Team USA’s most impactful players at the plate. Defensively, while his involvement was limited, Ward displayed reliability with no errors in his appearances. Ward’s hitting is clearly his primary asset, and his power potential makes him a valuable contributor in any lineup building off his previous season in AAA. With continued refinement of his approach, particularly reducing his strikeouts, Ward could elevate his game even further and cement himself as a premier power hitter in the lower half of a lineup at the big league level.

        <h1> Kim Do-yeong</h1>

        <p>
            Kia Tigers of the Korean Baseball League have themselves a bright young star in Kim Doyeong, the 21 year old out of Gwangju, Korea was picked up by the southern team in 2022 regional draft signing for 4억원 ($308,000). He made quick work in the league,in 2024 becoming the youngest & shortest time taken player to record a 30 stolen base and 30 home run season (30-30). Kia Tigers of the Korean Baseball League have themselves a bright young star in Kim Do-yeong, the 21 year old out of Gwangju, Korea was picked up by the southern team in 2022 regional draft signing for 4억원 ($308,000). He made quick work in the league,in 2024 becoming the youngest & shortest time taken player to record a 30 stolen base and 30 home run season (30-30) finishing the year with 38 Home Runs and 40 stolen bases. He continued this dominant performance into the premier 12 tournament where he was limited on the base path likely due to more polished catching performances from opposing team’s as well as a less aggressive baserunning approach by the Korean National Team. He was still among the top offensive contributors in the tournament, slashing a 1.059 slugging. Kim Do-yeong's batting display with Team Korea in 2024 was quite remarkable. He is positioned as an elite offensive weapon with a .412 BA /.444 OBP offensive line and 1.503 OPS, which showed his ability to hit for both power and average. Kim was a significant component of his team's offence, contributing at crucial times with three home runs and ten RBIs in just five games. Kim's ability to blend clutch hitting, power, and consistency makes him an exceptional player and a valuable member of Team Korea. He has the potential to become a superstar at higher level if he keeps improving his strategy and increasing his aggressiveness like the 2024 KBO season. I believe he would have a lot of value to an MLB organization being a plus hitter to both pull and opposite fields and a game changer on the bases. Regardless, Kim will be a name to watch come next season and certainly one to consider on MLB international signing boards.

        <h1> Matt Shaw</h1>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XxKF2DzAKy8?si=Kb5ZqVKQ0zH7lZSk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
        
         <p> Another bright future start from the USA team, Matt Shaw hails from the University of Maryland where was awarded first team all BIG TEN in 2022 and later won Cape Cod Summer Player of the year after a showcase of his five-tool potential. With a .360 BA/.432 OBP/.574 SLG slash line and a 1.006 OPS, he combined elite hitting, speed, and power to emerge as one of the league's standout performers. He continued this elite performance into his senior season where he hit 341/.445/.697 slash line and an elite 1.142 OPS. Shaw’s ability to hit for power (24 home runs), get on base consistently (.445 OBP), and contribute on the basepaths (18 stolen bases) solidifies his status as one of the top collegiate hitters in 2023 falling just shy as a semifinalist for the golden spikes award. After that elite performance MLB scouts were extremely high on his potential and the Chicago Cubs landed him in the 1st round, 13th overall. He has been a force of nature in the minors over the last two seasons, in 2023 after a long season at Maryland he climbed his way through 3 levels of the minors from Rookie → AA hitting .357 BA/.400 OBP /.618 SLG offensive line on his first season on pro ball. The next season was slightly different after getting off to a slower start in AA, he pulled things together and earned himself a promotion to AAA after some mid season roster moves in the Cubs organization. He finished off the season in AAA where he hit .298 BA /.395 OBP /.534 SLG. This performance rolled right into the premier 12 tournament where he was a key producer for the team, highlighted by a .412/.500/.706 offensive line and a 1.206 OPS. His performance over the last couple years has earned him a reputation as a great player with high upside cemented by this consistent performance, showing that he is prepared to compete in the MLB with many scouts comparing offensive abilities to Mike Trout. The 23 year old has produced well for the cubs and is in talks about being a key role player with the big league club this upcoming season. Matt Shaw will certainly be a guy to watch come spring training and 2025 Opening Day.
